# MQTT Supplier

This module provides an MQTT supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the `MqttPahoMessageDrivenChannelAdapter` from Spring Integration.
`mqttSupplier` is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream from MQTT sources. The supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and then receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `MqttSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`mqttSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `mqttSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `mqtt.supplier` and `mqtt`.

For more information on the various options available, please see https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/supplier/mqtt-supplier/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/mqtt/MqttSupplierProperties.java[MqttSupplierProperties].

## Tests

See this https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/supplier/mqtt-supplier/src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/mqtt/MqttSupplierTests.java[test suite] for the various ways, this supplier is used.
In addition to this, there is also https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/functions/common/mqtt-common/src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/common/mqtt/MqttProperties.java[this set of properties] to consider.

## Other usage

See this https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/source/mqtt-source/README.adoc[README] where this supplier is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application where it makes an MQTT Source.
